# METADADTA UTILITY

## IMPORTANT !!!
Create two folders "input" and "photos" in the main directory. Otherwise the program will not work.
## Purpose

This utility is designed as an aid to a larger application I am creating. The purpose is to output the metadata of the images in a JSON file while renaming and resizing the images for later use on the web. Normally the input images have very high quality and that's why we need to resize them, otherwise their weight would be too big for the web.

## Usage
Place input photos in input folder, then run main.py to rename and resize the photos(the photos will apear in the photos folder). 

Later if you want run the createJSON.py file to  create the data.json file.

# METADADTA UTILITY

## IMPORTATN !!!
Create two folders "input" and "photos" in the main directory. Otherwise the program will not work.
## Purpose
---
This utility is designed as an aid to a larger application I am creating. The purpose is to output the metadata of the images in a JSON file while renaming and resizing the images for later use on the web. Normally the input images have very high quality and that's why we need to resize them, otherwise their weight would be too big for the web.

## Usage
Place input photos in input folder, then , a data.json file will be created and all the new enumerated photos will be created in the photos folder.
